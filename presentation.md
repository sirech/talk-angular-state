# What is state management?

???

State management I think about something like redux

I am a declared _React_ fan

Probably unqualified to provide too many opinions on _Angular_

Will do so anyway

# Patterns

---

class: transition

# Input/Output

---

# What

--

Most components do not hold their own state

--

Instead, they receive their data as `@Input`, and trigger changes upstream with `@Output`

--

Presentational Components, Dumb Components, Functional Components

---


## Example

```typescript
class SimpleComponent {
  @Input() selectedDate: Date;
  @Output() onJump = new EventEmitter<Date>();

  jumpBack(date: Date) {
    this.onJumpto.emit(date);
  }
}
```

# Let's take a break to talk about bad ideas

---

class: transition

# ViewChild

---

# What

--

A way to bind a child component to a variable

--

Access the child's component state directly

---

```typescript
class Evil {
  @ViewChild(PoorChildrenComponent)
  sayGoodbyeToEncapsulation: PoorChildrenComponent; 

  beEvil() {
    this.sayGoodbyeToEncapsulation.changeStuffExternally();
  }
}
```

# Nested Forms

---

# What

--

Combine multiple forms

--

Treat them as one

---

```html
  <!-- Parent component template -->
  <child-component
    [parentForm]="formGroup">
```

---

```typescript
class ChildComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() parentForm: FormGroup
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.parentForm.setControl('stuff', this.myControl);
  }
}
```

---

```typescript
class ParentComponent implements OnInit {
  formGroup: FormGroup
  
  youWontLikeThis() {
    this.formGroup.get('stuff').setValue('surprise!');
  }
}

```

---

class: transition

# Service as a Global

---

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class GlobalService {
  stuff: string
  moreStuff: string
}
```

---

# What

--

`Redux` for angular

## This will be the final solution, I thought

---

# The harsh reality of introducing _Redux_

- _Redux_ is not the easiest library to explain, specially to developers without a frontend background
- Incremental adoption is problematic
- Not as established as a pattern in the community

---

class: transition

# Data Services

---

# What

A _Service_ that:

- holds data
- offers an API to manipulate it
- provides a way to get notified of updates

---

## A simple service

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class Store {
  private timeslotSubject = new BehaviorSubject<string>(null);
  timeslot$ = this.timeslotSubject.asObservable();

  selectTimeslot(timeslot: string) {
    this.timeslotSubject.next(timeslot);
  }
}

```

---

## Changing the state

```typescript
class Publisher implements OnInit {
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  onSelection(ts: string) {
    this.store.selectTimeslot(ts);
  }
}
```

---

## Getting updates

```typescript
class Subscriber implements OnInit {
  timeslot: string
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.store.timeslot$
      .filter(ts => !!ts)
      .subscribe(ts => this.timeslot = ts)
  }
}
```

---

# Caveats

- Only partially adopted
- Not always clear which components should subscribe
- Should a publisher hold its own state, or get it through the service as well?

# Summary

---

# Learnings

- `Angular` offers many shortcuts that can be easily misused
- **Discipline** is needed to keep your app under control
- _Data Services_ seem to be the most accepted pattern
- _Input/Output_ work as well, specially for simple apps
